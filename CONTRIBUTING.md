# Contributing

This repository is a documentation-first portfolio artifact for SNHU CS-319.

External contributions are welcome for the following categories.

1. Corrections to links, spelling, or formatting
2. Clarity improvements that reduce duplication and improve scan speed
3. Accessibility improvements (WCAG 2.2 alignment)
4. Visual impact improvements that preserve discipline and conciseness

Substantive changes to the SafeHaven concept, user stories, or scope should be proposed as an issue first.

All changes should keep the portfolio within course scope and maintain an auditable evidence trail.
