# User Needs Summary

## Operational context

SafeHaven supports a caregiver monitoring a relative with dementia.

The operational environment is fatigue, time pressure, and high consequence failure modes (wandering and stove risk).

## Primary user needs

1. Situational awareness at a glance
2. Rapid, low-friction action during critical events
3. Error prevention for irreversible actions
4. Confidence that actions completed (closed-loop feedback)
5. Accessibility that accounts for reduced dexterity and visual acuity
