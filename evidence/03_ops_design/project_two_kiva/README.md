# Project Two Scaffold - Kiva

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Not%20Started-lightgrey)

## Purpose

Project Two will apply CS-319 principles to a constrained borrower interface (embedded device) and a lender-facing cloud application.

This repository keeps Project Two as a planned mission set so the Project One evidence remains clean and auditable.

## Embedded device (borrower) notes

Constraints to document and design against.

1. Limited display size and input capability
2. Low bandwidth and intermittent connectivity
3. High clarity and low interaction cost

## Cloud application (lender) notes

Topics to document for planning.

1. Data visualization priorities and filter controls
2. Information hierarchy and comprehension
3. Component communication plan and modularization

## Status

Not started. Planned for later integration after the course submission.
