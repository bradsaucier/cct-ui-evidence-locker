# After Action Review

## Mission result

Repository upgraded to reduce duplication, improve recruiter scan speed, and increase visual impact without leaving CS-319 scope.

## Changes executed

1. README navigation strip consolidated to one line
2. Triage section added as the recruiter start point
3. Mermaid diagrams corrected for GitHub rendering
4. Definitions centralized and referenced from critique and platform notes
5. Project Two placeholders merged into a single scaffold
6. CI workflows hardened with concurrency and robust globs

## Next iteration targets

1. Replace workflow badge URLs if repository name differs from the recommended name
2. Validate Mermaid rendering directly on GitHub after upload
3. Review alt text and contrast assumptions with a formal accessibility pass
