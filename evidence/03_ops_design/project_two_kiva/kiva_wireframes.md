# Kiva wireframes

## Purpose

This file provides the wireframe index and operator notes for the Kiva borrower USSD flow used in CS-319 Project Two.

## Primary artifact

- Wireframe image: [kiva_borrower_ussd_wireframe.png](../../../assets/img/wireframes/kiva/kiva_borrower_ussd_wireframe.png)
- Consolidated project notes: [README.md](README.md)
- Submission report: [CS319_Project_Two_Report.pdf](../../../submissions/CS319_Project_Two_Report.pdf)

## Design controls

- Flat menu structure to reduce USSD timeout exposure
- Numeric input only for keypad reliability
- Short strings to reduce reading load and session duration
- Shared-device privacy control with fast exit option
- Echo-back confirmation before payment commit

## Notes

The full narrative rationale and system context are maintained in [README.md](README.md) within this folder and in the submission report linked above.
