# Design Tokens

Tokens act as a single source of truth for semantic UI meaning.

This is documentation-first. Tokens are included to show how the SafeHaven visual system could scale across mobile, watch, and kiosk without duplicating decisions.

| Token | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| color.status.critical.bg | Background for life safety alerts |
| color.status.critical.text | Text for critical alerts |
| interaction.hold.duration_ms | Press-and-hold duration for irreversible actions |

Values live in design_system/tokens.json.
